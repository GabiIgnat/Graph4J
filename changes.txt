1.0.3
  
1.0.2	2023-04-09
  - Improved algorithm for enumerating maximal cliques: org.graph4j.alg.clique.BronKerboschCliqueIterator
  - Examples of using Graph4J API: org.graph4j.examples
  - Support for tournament graphs: org.graph4j.alg.Tournament
	(determining if a digraph is tournament, obtaining a hamiltonian path in a tournament)
  
1.0.1	2023-03-19
  - New algorithm for single pair shortest path: org.graph4j.alg.sp.BidirectionalDijkstra
  - New algorithm for bridge detection: org.graph4j.alg.connectivity.BridgeDetectionAlgorithm
  - Bug: Graph.maxVertexNumber() was not correct (should return -1 in case of an empty graph)
  - Bug: Graph.addVertex() was not correct (due to maxVertexNumber being incorrect)
